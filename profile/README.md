Globus Labs is a research group led by Prof. Ian Foster and Dr. Kyle Chard that spans the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago and the [Data Science and Learning Division](https://www.anl.gov/dsl) at Argonne National Laboratory.
We work closely with [Globus](https://globus.org), a non-profit data management platform operated out of UChicago that supports research cyberinfrastructure.

We engage in diverse research centered around scientific and high-performance computing.
* **AI for Science:** using AI as a paradigm for enabling scientific discovery.
* **Data-intensive computing:** managing the parallel processing of large data volumes on high-performance computing infrastructure.
* **Distributed computing:** managing computations across compute clusters or federated collections of cloud, high-performance computing, and edge systems.
* **Research data management:** enabling reliable, efficient, and secure transfer, sharing, and discovery of large and distributed data.

Many of our active projects are hosted in other GitHub organizations, including:
* **Colmena** [[homepage](https://colmena.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | [code](https://github.com/exalearn/colmena)]: Steering campaigns of simulations on supercomputers
